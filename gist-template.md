# Matching an email - Regex Tutorial

This tutorial is going to explain the use of regex to match an email address.

## Summary

Regular Expressions or Regex (in short) in Java is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching, manipulating, and editing a string in Java. Email validation and passwords are a few areas of strings where Regex is widely used to define the constraints. 

In this tutorial we will be breaking down a Regex that helps matching an email address. Here is the following code :
 `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
